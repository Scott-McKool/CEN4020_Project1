## How to contribute to this project

Do not commit directly to the master branch.

Make your changes in your own branch. When your changes are stable and ready to be merged, I will merge the changes into the master branch.

When a change to the master branch happens, make sure to merge master into your branch so that you're working with the most up-to-date code.
